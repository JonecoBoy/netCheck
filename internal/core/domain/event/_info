Events are part of the domain because they represent changes or actions that are significant to the business logic. They encapsulate domain-specific information and are used to communicate these changes across different parts of the system.

By placing events in the domain layer, you ensure that they are closely tied to the business logic and can be easily accessed and used by other parts of the domain. The application layer can then focus on handling these events and coordinating the necessary actions.
